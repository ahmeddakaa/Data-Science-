---Inspecting Data

---Checking Unique Values
SELECT DISTINCT "STATUS" FROM "Sales_data"--- nice to plot

SELECT DISTINCT "PRODUCTLINE" FROM "Sales_data"---nice to plot
SELECT DISTINCT "COUNTRY" FROM "Sales_data"---nice to plot

---Analysis
---Let's start by grouping Sales by Productline
SELECT "PRODUCTLINE" , SUM("SALES"::DECIMAL)
FROM "Sales_data"
GROUP BY "PRODUCTLINE"
ORDER BY 2 DESC

SELECT "YEAR_ID" , SUM("SALES"::DECIMAL)
FROM "Sales_data"
GROUP BY "YEAR_ID"
ORDER BY 2 DESC

SELECT "DEALSIZE", SUM("SALES"::decimal)
FROM "Sales_data"
GROUP BY "DEALSIZE"
ORDER BY 2 DESC

--- what was the best month for sales in a specific year? How much was earned that month?
SELECT "MONTH_ID",SUM("SALES"::decimal) AS Revenue, COUNT("ORDERNUMBER"::integer) AS FREQUENCY
FROM "Sales_data"
WHERE ("YEAR_ID"::integer) = 2003 --- change year to see the rest
GROUP BY "MONTH_ID"
ORDER BY 2 DESC

--- November seems to be the best month , what products do theysell in November , Classic I believe
SELECT "MONTH_ID","PRODUCTLINE",SUM("SALES"::decimal) AS Revenue, count("ORDERNUMBER"::integer) AS Frequency
FROM "Sales_data"
WHERE ("MONTH_ID"::integer)= 11
AND ("YEAR_ID"::integer) = 2003 --- change the year to see the rest
GROUP BY "MONTH_ID", "PRODUCTLINE"
ORDER BY 3 DESC
