# [Project 1 : RFM analysis](https://github.com/ahmeddakaa/Data-Science-) 
 I explored a sales dataset and generate various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behavior. I went from analyzing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. I used SQL queries to explore complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions.The following skills were untilized:
- Importing a file into SQL Server Database
- SQL Aggregate Functions
- SQL Window Functions
- SQL Sub Query
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Tableau
